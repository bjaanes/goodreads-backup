# Goodreads Backup
Python script to back up your Goodreads shelves.

Uses the Goodreads API's to fetch data.

The reasoning for writing this script was that Goodreads seems to have some pretty buggy apps, and I don't completly trust them with keeping all my data safe. My to-read list is especially important for me to not lose.

The script fetches all your books from all shelves and saves them to seperate CSV files.
