# Goodreads Backup
Python application to back up your Goodreads shelves.

Will use Goodreads API's to fetch data.

Application still in early infancy. The exact functionality is not yet determined. 

The reasoning behind this project was to save my lists in case Goodreads decide to delete them or in any way corrupts my data.
Goodreads seems to have rather low quality in their software, so I don't really trust them to keep my data safe.

Functionality and use cases not yet determined. Will probably change during development.

If you want to chime in with ideas or even code, feel free to do so!
